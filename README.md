# SmartWarmUp

Smart WarmUp is an app designed for vocalists who seek an easy way to warm up their voices without needing a piano. Users will be able to select warmups from a list, input the octave level, the number of intervals, and the starting key, and then sing along as the app plays the notes. Eventually, users will be able to make playlists of their favorite warmups and create and edit their own warmups.
